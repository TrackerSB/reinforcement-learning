# Learning to Drive Smoothly in Minutes

This is a version of [araffin's](https://github.com/araffin) reinforcement learning approach using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with a variational encoder (VAE) adopted and trained on BeamNG.research.



## Install and use trained AI with DriveBuild
0. Install the dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
1. Most probably ```Shapely``` is going to make troubles during the installation. If you use Anaconda, you can install Shapely by executing
```conda install shapely```
in your conda environment. Otherwise, please, follow the instructions from [this](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/62925/why-is-shapely-not-installing-correctly/62931#62931) post.
2. Import the ```DDPGAI``` class from ```ai.py``` (root directory)
3. Instantiate an object and execute the ```.start(sid, vid)``` method

```
from ai import DDPGAI
from client.aiExchangeMessages_pb2 import SimulationID, VehicleID

ai = DDPGAI()

sid = SimulationID()
sid.sid = "some simulation id"

vid = VehicleID()
vid.vid = "ego"

ai.start(sid, vid)
```

For best results a minimum controller frequency of 20 Hz should be used. The optimum controller frequency is 50 Hz. 
 
### Modes
There are two pretrained variational encoders and models which were trained on roads generated by [AsFault](https://github.com/alessiogambi/AsFault).
However, different environments were used:

1. Pure smallgrid level (the environment does not contain anything but the road)
2. Smallgrid level filled with grass

For both environments the same road materials were used:
0. Asphalt: ```a_asphalt_01_a```
1. Mid line marking: ```line_yellow```
2. Left and right line markings: ```line_white```

Pure smallgrid        | Smallgrid filled with grass
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![result](content/pure_mode.gif)  | ![result](content/grass_mode.gif)
```LEVEL_NAME = Level.PURE``` | ```LEVEL_NAME = Level.GRASS``` 

By default a VAE and an agent trained in the grass environment are used.
In ```config.py``` it is defined as ```LEVEL_NAME = Level.GRASS```.
Change it to ```LEVEL_NAME = Level.PURE``` in order to use the VAE and the agent which were trained in the pure smallgrid environment. 
Make sure to use the correct mode, otherwise you may encounter some weird behavior. **(Note: the agent which was trained in the pure smallgrid environment performs much worse than the ones trained in the grass environment)**

### Camera properties
During the training the front camera was used with these properties:
1. Position: ```(0, 1.4, 1.8)``` 
2. Direction: ```(0, 1, -0.23)``` 
3. Field of view (FOV): ```120```
4. Resolution (Width, Height): ```(160, 120)```
